# CMScoutIntrinsicCommunity
Source code of the great CMScoutIntrinsic tool created by vfilatov


If you want more details or simply use the tool, see here: https://champman0102.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=2659


Or, if you are a programmer and want to make changes to the source code, read this info below:

The author (vfilatov) allowed my to upload the source code here in this github project. He also allowed me or the community to continue the development of the tool as desired.

You can use Visual Studio 2017 to build the project.

This source code only doesn't contain the CMScoutIntrinsic_StoreKey.pfx file from the original author. Thats the key from the Microsoft Developer Account of the tool. To build the project you should generate other key (from Store or temporary). Please see the following link for more details:

If we want to publish a new version of the app in the Microsoft Store, we need some developer account for this. Maybe you have an account or another enthusiast. Since the name 'CM Scout Intrinsic' is already reserved under vfilatov account we can choose a different name, for example 'CM Scout Intrinsic Community'.

Now the cost for registering an account is about $19 according to the following page:

Alternativelly, we can port the source code to another platform that doesnt require using a Microsoft Store account.
